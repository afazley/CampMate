## Overview

CampMate is a modern, lightweight app that helps users locate campsites based on their current GPS location or by entering a custom address. It's designed for speed, usability, and offline readiness ‚Äî with support for caching previously loaded campsites.

This project demonstrates my understanding of mobile development using .NET MAUI and real-world APIs, as well as handling asynchronous data, state management, and responsive UI design.

## Key Features

- **Map Integration** ‚Äì Interactive map using `Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Maps`
- **Use GPS** ‚Äì Automatically detects and loads nearby campsites
- **Address Search** ‚Äì Type any location with Google Maps Autocomplete
- **Location Picker** ‚Äì Suggests valid addresses to prevent input errors
- **Offline Caching** ‚Äì Save campsite results for use without network
- **Refresh & Reset Controls** ‚Äì Reload or change search dynamically
- **Smooth UI** ‚Äì Animated loading spinner and minimalistic design

---

## Tech Stack

- **.NET MAUI** ‚Äì Cross-platform app framework (.NET 9)
- **Google Maps API** ‚Äì Location search and geocoding
- **SQLite** ‚Äì Local data caching (planned feature)
- **C# Async/Await** ‚Äì Responsive UX

## How It Works

- On app launch, GPS location is retrieved via MAUI Essentials.
- The map is centered on user's position, and nearby campsites are fetched.
- User can also click "Change Address" to search manually via Google Autocomplete.
- Campsites are displayed in a list and visually on the map.
- A loading indicator shows while location and data are being fetched.
- Results can be optionally cached for later use.

## Future Improvements

- Sync cached results with a cloud backend
- Add unit/integration tests for location logic
- Improve map pins with additional data (e.g. images, reviews)
- User preferences for radius/filtering

## Why This Project?

I built CampMate to:

- Demonstrate practical skills in .NET MAUI and real-time data APIs
- Show real-world problem solving (e.g. location UI, error handling)
- Reflect my interest in mobile development, mapping, and user-first design
- Lastly, express my interest in camping, and showing an initiative to fix a problem many campsite finder apps     have - the ability to cache/download data in advance
